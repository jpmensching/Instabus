## FAQ

### What happened to MetroRappid?

MetroRappid has been renamed to Instabus.

MetroRappid for iOS has been replaced with Instabus.

MetroRappid for Android (winner of ATX Hack For Change) had problems working with the Google Maps API. We've chosen to move in the direction of open data, and now instead use OpenStreetMaps. This webapp replaces MetroRappid for Android.

### Why is the vehicle location out of date?

CapMetro only updates the vehicle location every 30-90 seconds. You should encourage them to provide more accurate realtime data.
